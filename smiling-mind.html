                <h3>SMILING MIND CASE STUDY</h3>
                <p>Smile Mind is a non-profit organization that seek to help all minds thrive. The aim of Smiling Mind
                    is to bring about a generational shift in mental health in Australia. Their lifelong, evidence-based
                    tools provide the fundamental mental fitness skills needed to support good mental health and
                    resilience from an early age.</p>

            <h4>Case Study Details</h4>

            <p>
                I worked on this case study for a period of five (5) weeks in a remote team around the world, focused on
                trying to study about how Smiling Mind began primarily for younger students but now they want to better
                serve the hybrid and remote workforce.
                <br />
                <br />
                The task was to better understand this user segment and help the Smiling Mind team better understand the
                needs and goals of those working remotely or hybrid looking to try meditation.
            </p>

            <h4>Research Plan</h4>
            <p>We kick started this case study with a research plan. This research plan entailed, the problem space, the
                research goals, research methods, participants, session lengths, incentives and timelines. Having a
                research plan played a very important role during this case study as it helped keep us on track, it also
                allowed us to work with constraints, we understood our timelines and it helped us to be organised and
                focused with our research.
            </p>

            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>
                Smilling Mind was designed for younger students, not for the hydrid and remote workforce. And they do
                not know the needs and goals and of this user segment they seek to reach.
            </p>

            <h4>Research Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>To understand why they would want to start meditation</li>
                <li>
                    To understand the goals of the remote and hybrid workforce trying meditation for the first time.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Research Methods</h4>
            <p>The following research methods were adopted for this research;</p>

            <ul>
                <li>User Interviews</li>
                <li>User Surveys</li>
                <li>Usability Tests</li>

                    <h4>Research Interviews</h4>

                    <p>
                        After drawing out the research plan, my team member and I moved on start prepping for our
                        research
                        interview. As part of this, we prepared a research script and also conducted interviews.

                    <p>
                        The purpose for conducting these user interviews was to get descriptive, contextual
                        understanding of target audience needs, attitudes/beliefs and behaviors of our users.

                    <p>
                        The interviews was also to enable us ascertain the users painpoints and help us be able to
                        empathize with the user.

                <h4>Survey & Benchmarking</h4>

                <p>
                    After successfully conducting our research interviews, we created a survey which was distributed to
                    our target users (remote/hybrid workers). This survey was made up of closed and open ended
                    questions. The purpose of the survey was to help us get quantitative and qualitative insights about
                    users. Below are some of the insights we gathered from our target users.
                </p>

                    We benchmarked against two competitiors for this case study. Namely <span>“Calm”</span> and
                    <span>“HeadSpace”</span>. This
                    benchmarking was done so we could have a standard to refer to as we improved the product
                    <span>(Smiling
                        Mind)</span>. This was also to draw inspiration and to check existing UX and UI standards.

                    <p>
                        We conducted moderated and unmoderated usability tests to help us identify problems and
                        potential
                        improvements to check if users understand the navigation, observe how easily and quickly people
                        accomplish tasks with Smiling Mind. Users undertook a total of four (4) tasks based on scenarios
                        presented them. Below are some of the results of unmoderated tests.

                <h4>Synthesis</h4>

                <p>
                    After collecting data from our respondents, we had to breakdown the information to generate
                    actionable insights. This was achieved using Dovetail, a tool for capturing customer feedback and
                    user research in one place. It acts as user research repository for centralising interview notes and
                    storing video and images, with tagging and annotations to help with analysis.
                </p>
                <div class="image-wrap" style="margin-top: 150px">
                    <img src="/assets/images/smile/systhensis-1.png" alt="systhensis-1" style="width: 801px;">
                </div>

                <p>
                    From analysis of data gathered from users, we deduced that 65.33% were irritated by the voices of
                    coaches on the meditation app and hence would drop off without completing a session. Whereas 34.67%
                    preferred to be guided through out a session. This would mean that smiling mind would have to
                    include the ability of their users to opt for coaches for a session or develop a different type of
                    meditation where the user would not require a coach.
                </p>

                <div class="image-wrap" style="margin-top: 150px">
                    <img src="/assets/images/smile/systhensis-2.png" alt="systhensis-2" style="width: 801px;">
                </div>

                <p>
                    It was also deduced as seen from above that 18.51% of our respondents tried meditation in order to
                    have clarity of mind to carry out their basic activities and duties. To help users achieve that,
                    meditation sessions should be tailored towards enabling users to achieve clarity whenever they
                    decide to join a session on the App.

                    <h4>Research Report</h4>
                    <p>
                        After the information was synthesized, we pulled all of our relevant findings together in a
                        digestible, easy to read format, with conclusions and recommendations. The aim is to make it
                        easy for all stakeholders to have a quick read and understand the insights from this research so
                        that important discussions and decisions can be made.

                <h4 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 20px;">Lessons Learnt</h4>

                <p>
                    One very difficult part during this case study was accepting that we were not the users. During the
                    moderated usability tests, I thought everything was extremely clear and basic and we were tempted to
                    help out users to complete the tasks stated in each scenario. It made me realise that UX
                    professionals must be able to get out of their own heads, interact with a cross-section of users,
                    empathize with them, and apply what they’ve shared to the product development process.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Another
                    important lesson learnt is to always have a research plan. Having a research plan really helped to
                    make use of time and resources efficiently, decide what is to be done and why it should be done and
                    it helped to focus on one thing at a time.
