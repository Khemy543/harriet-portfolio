                <h3>SMILING MIND CASE STUDY</h3>
                <p>Smile Mind is a non-profit organization that seek to help all minds thrive. The aim of Smiling Mind
                    is to bring about a generational shift in mental health in Australia. Their lifelong, evidence-based
                    tools provide the fundamental mental fitness skills needed to support good mental health and
                    resilience from an early age.</p>

            <h4>Case Study Details</h4>

            <p>
                I worked on this case study for a period of five (5) weeks in a remote team around the world, focused on
                trying to study about how Smiling Mind began primarily for younger students but now they want to better
                serve the hybrid and remote workforce.
                <br />
                <br />
                The task was to better understand this user segment and help the Smiling Mind team better understand the
                needs and goals of those working remotely or hybrid looking to try meditation.
            </p>

            <h4>Research Plan</h4>
            <p>We kick started this case study with a research plan. This research plan entailed, the problem space, the
                research goals, research methods, participants, session lengths, incentives and timelines. Having a
                research plan played a very important role during this case study as it helped keep us on track, it also
                allowed us to work with constraints, we understood our timelines and it helped us to be organised and
                focused with our research.
            </p>

            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>
                Smilling Mind was designed for younger students, not for the hydrid and remote workforce. And they do
                not know the needs and goals and of this user segment they seek to reach.
            </p>

            <h4>Research Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>To understand why they would want to start meditation</li>
                <li>
                    To understand the goals of the remote and hybrid workforce trying meditation for the first time.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Research Methods</h4>
            <p>The following research methods were adopted for this research;</p>

            <ul>
                <li>User Interviews</li>
                <li>User Surveys</li>
                <li>Usability Tests</li>
            </ul>

                <h4>Research Interviews</h4>

                <p>
                    After drawing out the research plan, my team member and I moved on start prepping for our research
                    interview. As part of this, we prepared a research script and also conducted interviews.
